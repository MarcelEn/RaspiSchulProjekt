//wedding:
in general: convert all ids to strings
calendar loading init => does not fetch all appointments (doch schon aber nur die aktiven)
    -> no response statuscode 200

not reproduceable => search calendar (userSetting changed something => add calendar => search user) => fetching loop

UserSettings username .... request 404

updating appointments response with 201 but does not affect the database

searching username (example on blur in registration) response with 500

delete calendar response with 500

search calendar search_string only does not work

appointment refacoring is false => start and end is 0 (backend)
